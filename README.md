# LOSAnalysis

# Problem Statement: 
Telecom companies struggle with time-consuming and resource-heavy on-site line of sight (LOS) surveys for network expansion and upgrades. This leads to delays, inefficiencies, and potential connectivity issues due to inaccurate planning.

# Data Integration: 
Utilize open-source weather APIs, satellite imagery and datasets for real-time data for model training and testing.
# Data Processing:
Issue 1:   Develop Python scripts for integration and preprocessing.
Utilizing a U-Net CNN architecture for precise and efficient building detection in remote sensing imagery.
#
Issue 2: develop python scripts using Earth observation data from sources like NASAâ€™s EOSDIS and ArcGIS for weather/climatic updates.
#
Issue 3:  To determine terrain updates using the Eurosat Sentinel 2 data and implementing ResNet-50 for accurate terrain detection in aerial imagery.

#  LOS Analysis Mapping and Visualization:
Use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Ploting for dynamic visualizations, including heatmaps and 3D models.
